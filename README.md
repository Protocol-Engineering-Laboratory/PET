# PET in Blockchain
# 1. :dizzy: Introduction
This project aims to contribute to the development of decentralized applications (dApps) that combine blockchain technology with PET to ensure security and privacy protection. While existing blockchain networks guarantee trust and transparency, they also present risks of exposing users' personal information. Therefore, our project proposes a solution that maximizes the benefits of blockchain while securely protecting privacy.

| Homomorphic Encryption (HE) | Technologies that allow data to be combined and computed/analyzed while encrypted                                                                                                                     |
| Differential Privacy (DP) | A system that withholds and distorts certain information about the privacy of a dataset to provide a more personalized view of it, using precise mathematical algorithms that add noise and parameters  |
| Synthetic Data (SD) | Artificially generated data through a variety of methodologies, including rigorous sampling from real-world data, semantic approaches, simulated scenarios, etc                                               |
| Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) | Technology to perform collaborative analysis of sensitive data held by multiple organizations without disclosing sensitive data                                                             |
| Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) | Privacy-preserving messaging protocols that allow you to prove that information is accurate without having to send or share underlying information                                                     |
| Federated Learning (FL) | Technologies that deliver machine learning models to where the data is stored to run training locally, eliminating the need to share or store data in a centralized location                              |
| Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) | Technology that provides a secure area within the main processor for confidential data processing to enhance data security                                                                    |
